Welcome to Pakenham Hospital's PMS Project! 
This ReadME serves as a walkthrough for the PMS, to guide the viewer on a curated journey into understanding the purpose of this PMS and how it was made.
This PMS has been constructed across three different platforms. 
HTML has been utlized for frontend development, with Javascript elements incorporated.
SQL on MySQL was utilized for the database.
Java serves as the backend. The chosen IDE used by the developer was Eclipse.
Do read the MySQL syntax file attached, it'll guide you through password configuration for the database.
Through the course of this project the developer not only learned how to develop a software, but also how to migrate it to a different machine.
After you download the repository's code, import the project into Eclipse and adjust the jdk library to your personal device's within the build path, to resolve the jdk unbound error. This is the first step to take when migrating to a new machine.
This project was developed on the latest version of Eclipse. Ensure that everything is up to date.
Within the Server class, exists an exact path to the project on the developer's machine. This must be adjusted for yours, to let spark find the exact route.
Once everything is set up, run the Server class in Eclipse. You must be able to see the message "Spark is listening" in the console. 
Visit http://localhost:4581/login.html. Enter a username and password from the given SQL list (make sure to adjust SQL password configurations).
If you have followed all the above steps, you will be able to view a specialised dashboard! Other errors may be viewed in the console section of Eclipse after execution.
Any queries can be forwarded to the developer at k230302@student.kent.edu.au. This project has been tested across a total of four different machines. Screenshots of the inner workings of this PMS have also been provided in the accompanying report.
